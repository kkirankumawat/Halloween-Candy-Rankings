# Halloween-Candy-Rankings
## Task: To find the 3 treats to give out on Halloween to guarantee that trick-or-treaters of all tastes find something they’ll love and to present the data to back up the decision
## About Dataset: Data compiled from an experiment that set out to find the most popular Halloween candy by asking online voters to select their favorite from randomly generated matchups (for example, Twix or Snickers?). 
## Steps:
- Used linear regression algorithm to find the variables on which win percent depends. 
- The algorithm provided 3 variables: chocolate, fruity and peanutyalmondy
- Then, used clustering algorithm on these variables to form 3 clusters.
- The three clusters thus formed are: chocolaty, fruity and nutty and chocolaty (peanutyalmondy + chocolate).
- The model was used in Power BI for further visualization.
- For finding the top picks used scatter plot by filtering the data through win percentage.
## Findings:
**Top 3 picks:** Reese’s peanut buttercup (Nutty and chocolaty), Twix (Chocolaty) and Starburst (Fruity) – It includes picks from each flavor
- Top 3 candies on the basis of win-percent are: Reese’s peanut buttercup, Twix and Reese’s miniature
- There is no relation between sugar percent and price percent with win percent
- Nutty & chocolaty candies are less in quantity but have higher win percentage.
- Nutty & chocolaty candies have higher win percent (63.70) followed by cholcolaty (51.78). Fruity candies have least win percent of 44.12
- 44.71 % of candies are fruity, 38.82 % of candies are chocolaty and only 16.47 % of candies are having nuts and chocolates.
